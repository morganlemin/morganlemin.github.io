<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The majority of experts (71%) did not agree that FGS severity and FGS progression are the same thing. Some suggested that new infections can present with severe lesions, while longterm disease may not present with visually severe lesions.</p>
<p>Experts believe that severity should be the focus of a grading system as it may be more practical, clinically useful and evidence-based. Severity appears to be favoured over progression clinically due to being easier to assess, more potentially useful in monitoring treatment effect and more closely aligned with clinical decision making. At present, there may not be enough evidence available, such as biopsy or longitudinal data to base a grading system on progression. It may be that a progression-based grading system may be a useful tool once treatment options increase and further evidence becomes available.</p>
<p>The majority of experts believe that a simplified grading system should have three levels of severity. This would be easier to teach and implement. All experts believe that physical symptoms should be considered as part of a simplified grading system.</p>

<p>Severity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Severity show the extent of the organ damage and may be a useful tool to monitor response to treatment.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity is easier judge compared to progression, it would be difficult to tell whether the disease is early disease established or advanced, especially if you are seeing the patient for the first time.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>A comprehensive histopathological evaluation of all levels of the genital tract is necessary. Currently, there is a lack of robust studies involving systematic tissue biopsy. In my view, establishing such a study should be the first step. Only after obtaining objective histological data should a grading system be developed, as the existing system is largely based on subjective clinical assessments.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity depends on the affected sectors of cervicovaginal mucosa and the number of FGS lesion types. It would be difficult to identify clinically which lesions are in early stage and which ones are established/advanced?</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I think that the severity of the disease is more easily determined than the progression of the disease in that “advanced” disease may not necessarily correlate with the overt manifestation of the disease.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity is not necessarily related to the progression of the disease. It’s rather in relation with the physical symptoms.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity may be more clinically useful because it aligns directly with patient presentation and enables more responsive and appropriate interventions. while progression is hard to ascertain and without a clear historical timeline.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I recommend severity, because progression of disease may be attributed to other underlying factors like ones immunity.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Progession status could be made during review when comparisons are made.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I think that disease progression would likely need to be defined by biopsy? Otherwise, how would we know what is early stage, established or advanced? I don’t think there are enough solid data to support that some lesions are early (maybe rubbery papules) and some are late (maybe GSP - but we don’t have a lot of biopsy data to confirm that! Really only Kjetland 1996, Poggensee 2000, and Kjetland 2005 - but so few women in 2005 were actually biopsied).</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I do not believe severity and progression are the same. I would describe severity based on the extent and intensity of lesions. While progression may more be an expression of how long a woman has been infected and to what extent the lesions have become chronic. A young woman may have severe FGS, but an early/new infection. While a woman may be infected for a long period with “advanced FGS” or even chronic lesions, but not necessarily “severe”.</em></p>
<p><em>Both severity and progression, may be clinically important. Right now treatment options are limited and I would offer praziquantel to women with any signs of FGS. I can imagine in the future that treatment options may differ for women with severe FGS from women with advanced/chronic FGS. If I were to choose, i believe severity can better encompas both the extent/intensity of a lesion, as well as the chronicity.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Progression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Progression sounds more clinical and only few FGS participants would understand the term in a case of midwives or nurses discussing while examination is going on. This can reduce anxiety from participants.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>For FGS purpose, like one can visualize the cervix during type two Th2 immune reaction after egg deposition on tissues before fibrous granules formation, you might miss grain sand patch and probably see homogeneous, to me, disease progression matters and shows severity</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>By severity, I mean the various complications that can be observed during the course of FGS. These complications can be observed at different stages of FGS progression. So I would say classification by progression with or without signs of severity.</em></p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homogenous-sandy-patches">3.2 Homogenous sandy patches</h2>
<section id="summary-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-1">Summary</h4>
<p>In round one, the majority of experts believed that homogenous sandy patches should be included in a clinical grading system. In this round, 92% of experts states that would be comfortable diagnosing FGS based solely on the presence of HSP in the image they were given to review. There was no clear consensus on if HSPs reflect an earlier or later stage of disease. The majority of experts have seen HSPs without the use of any magnification tool. Additional comments suggest that HSPs can be hard to distinguish if they appear in the transformation zone or columna epithelium.</p>
<p>The visual appearance of homogenous sandy patches was described as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Colour - all mentions of colour stated that the lesions are ‘yellowish’. The term ‘sandy’ was used five times but may conflict with the idea that the lesions can be almost white in colour. In contrast to the pink of the cervical mucosa. The colour can vary in intensity (pale, almost white to deep yellow).</p></li>
<li><p>Size - can vary (as small as 5mm, large as &gt;1cm). They can cover large areas like a yellow ‘frost’ on the cervix.</p></li>
<li><p>Texture - smooth, paint-like, sheet-like, frost-like.</p></li>
<li><p>Borders - irregular and not always well-defined.</p></li>
<li><p>No distinct grains is a factor (previously a criteria of homogenous sandy patches). This was mentioned in three of the responses. The other 11 did not mention the need for absent individual grains, with one expert suggesting that some grains can be defined and visible within a larger homogenous sandy patch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Extent:</p>
<p>The general opinion was that the greater the extent of the lesion coverage, the more severe the case of FGS. Extent was generally described in relation to cervical quadrants. A mild case of FGS was defined as a HSP limited to one cervical quadrant, by those experts who mentioned a mild level (n = 6). A moderate case was suggested to involve 2-3 quadrants by most experts. For the experts that mentioned a severe case, most suggested that it should be defined by the involvement of all four quadrants, and up to coverage of the entire cervix.</p>
<p>It was suggested that greater extent could relate to an increase in inflammatory response, mucosal fragility, fibrosis and therefore overall symptoms. Further research is needed on this and it is premature to equate cervical surface coverage to true severity.</p>
<p>Intensity:</p>
<p>There is clear variation mentioned in terms of the intensity of colour, which can range from almost white to deep yellow (almost orange). Some experts suggest that the darker colour is an indication of more dense, long-term egg deposition and therefore severity. Others are hesitant to suggest relationships between intensity and severity due to the lack of evidence. Anecdotally, it appears that milder cases have a lighter appearance, while the HSP of a severe case can be deep yellow, almost orange in colour.</p>

<li><p><em>May not match the symptoms but is great for monitoring resolution of lesions.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Extent relate to severity yes because the coverage area shows how well fast the disease or eggs are spreading,,, there are times when you tell the presence of homogeneous sandy patches with good lighting upon inserting a spuculum even before using the colposcopy. It’s possible to have a suspicious homogeneous cervix then the colposcopy comes to aid.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiple or larger areas of homogenous yellow sandy patches could mean increased inflammatory response and more pronounced symptoms.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I believe this is a challenging question to address definitively. While a lesion may present superficially as a small, homogeneous sandy patch, the underlying pathology could be significantly more extensive. To date, we lack comprehensive cross-sectional histopathological studies to accurately characterize the full extent of disease involvement. Relying solely on surface appearance is inadequate for assessing severity, as lesions may be present in the fallopian tubes and ovaries, even in the absence of obvious cervical involvement. In my opinion, discussing disease severity without a thorough understanding of its histopathological distribution is premature and potentially misleading.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Yes, the extent of the lesion signifies the egg deposition, so if no egg deposition no inflammatory process, no FGS lesion formation.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The more widespread the lesion, the more severe the disease is likely to be. For example, a lesion covering more than 50% of the cervix may indicate severe disease.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>A mild case with HSP , in relation to extent, would mean coverage one quadrant and the measure of the HSP is less than 1 centimeter.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The extent of homogenous yellow sandy patches can provide useful insight when grading lesion severity/progression. few small patches suggest mild disease associated with no associated symptoms, while a moderate infection may present with other associated symptoms like pain during sexual intercourse or itching, it might present with Mutiple patches. Extensive patches associated mucosal fragility, or fibrosis may suggest a chronic infection.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Mild cases: single grains, may affect about 1-2 quadrant of cervix as severe case may have many clusters of grains, 3 to 4 quadrants of cervix is covered.</em></p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-2">Summary</h4>
<p>In round one, the majority of experts believed that GSPs should be included in a clinical grading system. In round two, 85% of experts stated they would be confident in diagnosing FGS based solely on the presence of GSPs. Again, there was no consensus regarding whether GSPs are related to earlier or later stages of disease. 71% of experts had not seen GSPs without the aid of a magnification tool, while 28% (n =4) had seen them with the naked eye. One expert raised the fact that GSPs are said to be pathognomonic for FGS (i.e.&nbsp;a sign that specifically characterises a particular disease). However, they pointed out that the evidence for this is limited.</p>
<p>The visual appearance of GSPs was defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Size – Very small, generally &lt;0.5mm.</p></li>
<li><p>Colour – Pale to deep yellow.</p></li>
<li><p>Shape – Oval, oblong, like ‘specs’ grains of rice or pinheads. Rarely perfectly round.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribution – Can be single scattered dots. Can also be clusters or ‘colonies’ (including large clusters of individual grains).</p></li>
<li><p>Texture – Can look rough, bumpy, raised, uneven. Like grains of sand trapped under the mucosa. In contrast to smooth homogenous sandy patches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Extent:</p>
<p>Again, extent of GSPs was generally discussed in relation to cervical quadrants. A mild case would involve up to one quadrant, a moderate case would involve 2-3 quadrants and a severe case would involve diffuse scattering or clusters in all four quadrants.</p>
<p>Some experts hypothesised that few isolated grains could indicate the early stage of egg deposition (and potentially a current infection), while extensive coverage would indicate higher egg deposition and chronic disease.</p>
<p>Intensity:</p>
<p>Colour and density have been given as two intensity-based indicators of infection. Some suggested that a lighter colour could indicate milder disease, while a darker colour could indicate more severe disease (possibly related to older egg deposits). Density was related to the spacing of the individual eggs/grains (sparse distribution = milder disease, dense clusters = severe disease/more profound egg deposition).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abnormal-vessels">3.4 Abnormal vessels</h2>
<section id="summary-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-3">Summary</h4>
<p>In round one, the majority of experts believed that abnormal vessels should be included in a clinical grading system. In round two, only 35% of experts stated that they were confident with their diagnosis of FGS if only abnormal vessels were present. This is a significant result and would suggest that while abnormal vessels could be included in a grading system, they should not necessarily be used as a standalone criteria. &nbsp;Abnormal vessels and neovascularisation can appear in various other infections and cervical conditions, which makes them nonspecific for FGS as a standalone criteria. Their presence, in combination with other lesion types may be a better indicator of disease/severity. 71% of experts agreed that abnormal vessels clustering around sandy patches may be a more distinguishing feature of FGS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The appearance of abnormal vessels was described as:</p>
<p>Shape – Can be short, (semi)circular, twisted, convoluted. Uneven in size.</p>
<p>Pattern – Irregular branching, ‘corkscrew’. May appear web-like.</p>
<p>Colour – Red (including dark red). In contrast with the surrounding mucosa.</p>
<p>Extent:</p>
<p>As with previous lesions, the discussion was mostly related to how many cervical quadrants were involved. Some experts suggested that a higher volume of abnormal vessels indicates a more severe disease, due to heavier egg deposition. A correlation between their volume and egg deposition was suggested due to the vessels often forming around sandy patches. For example, the presence of abnormal vessels in more than one quadrant could indicate severe disease. Many experts believed that there is no direct association between abnormal vessels and severity, unless they are associated with sandy patches.</p>
<p>Overall, there were few suggestions of how location may relate to severity. One expert suggested that involvement of the vaginal wall may relate to a more severe case. Another suggested that the appearance of abnormal vessels in the transformation zone may also indicate severity.</p>
<p>Intensity:</p>
<p>Colour intensity and clustering/density were suggested as intensity-based indicators that could support the assessment of severity. A few dark pink, faint and scattered vessels may indicate a mild case, while densely packed, red to dark red vessels may indicate increasing severity and abnormality. Tight clustering of the vessels was mentioned as an indicator of severe disease by many experts.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-4">Summary</h4>
<p>In round one, the majority of experts believed that rubbery papules should be included in a clinical grading system. The appearance of rubbery papules was described as:</p>
<p>Colour – White, pale, ‘yellowish’, beige, ‘fatty’, like “gum Arabic”. Sometimes partially translucent.</p>
<p>Shape – Circumscribed and smooth. Spherical, domed, pimple-like, growth-like. Raised/bulging from the mucosa.</p>
<p>Size – Small. Generally between 0.5-5mm.</p>
<p>Differentiation – Larger than GSPs. Differ from nabothian cysts by consistency (firmer), lack of vascular crossing and colour (pale, yellowish versus white).</p>
<p>Extent:</p>
<p>Unlike with previous lesions, the extent of rubbery papules was described using both volume and cervical quadrant involvement. This overlapped significantly with intensity, with many experts suggesting this was also related to volume and clustering of RPs. The sparse distribution of a few RPs may indicate mild disease whereas five or more RPs widespread across the cervix could indicate severe disease. One expert disagreed and believed that the presence of even one RP would indicate severe disease.</p>
<p>Intensity:</p>
<p>Volume and clustering of RPs was covered by extent. The size of the individual papules was suggested as an additional intensity-based indicator. Papules of ≤1mm would indicate mild disease (potentially related to lower egg deposition). 2-3mm would indicate moderate disease and 3mm+ would indicate severe disease.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-6">Summary</h4>
<p>In round one, the majority of experts believed that contact bleeding should be included in a clinical grading system. Contact bleeding was defined as bleeding from the mucosa as a result of contact (that would not normally cause bleeding) by a foreign object (e.g.&nbsp;speculum). It is due to the fragility of the mucosa, possibly due to the increased friability from egg deposition and neovascularisation. Usually bright red in colour, but can also be darker. Experts suggested that more extensively spread contact bleeding would be an indication of more severe disease. Widespread bleeding would suggest extensive mucosal damage.</p>
<p>The majority of experts (79%) stated they would not be confident in diagnosing FGS based on the presence of contact bleeding without any other FGS lesions. As contact bleeding is not a unique feature of FGS, it needs to be considered alongside the full diagnostic picture.</p>
