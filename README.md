# A scoping Delphi study for the co-development of a clinical visual grading system for female genital schistosomiasis. 

## Information sheet

#### What is the purpose of the study?

It has been more than ten years since members of the female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) field gathered to form a consensus on visual diagnostics for FGS. The resulting diagnostic criteria was based on the binary classification (presence/absence) of one or more of the classic lesion types (grainy sandy patches, homogenous sandy patches, abnormal vessels, and rubbery papules). The strictly binary diagnosis, which affords nothing to extent, severity or location of clinical signs, limits our ability to accurately assess and track the progression of FGS. The development of a more refined grading tool could not only provide guidance on the systematised classification of FGS symptoms but also inform appropriate management steps. Crucially, a grading system that records could also provide a method to monitor disease progression, treatment efficacy, disease persistence and reoccurrence. 

The aims of this study, using Delphi methodology, are:

1.	To review the list of clinical signs that experts believe can be used as visual diagnostic criteria. 
2.	To understand which clinical signs can be recorded in the granular terms of their severity, location, extent and presentation.
3.	To find consensus on the most appropriate scales, definitions, classifications that could be used to record each clinical sign
4.	To understand the use-cases for the rapid and the extended FGS clinical grading systems. 
5.	To build a rapid grading system (that could be used in field clinics) AND/OR a extended grading system (that can be used to fully characterise clinical signs from photographs). 
6.	To build a grading system to be used in visually diagnosing and classifying the severity of clinical signs of FGS. 


#### What will happen in each round?

The flow of this survey is shown in figure 1. The questionnaires have been validated by two external experts. After each questionnaire you will be provided with a summary of the results and opinions. This will be anonymised between the participants, however we will provide personalised reports to each expert participant, so you may see where your response sat in comparison with others. 

##### Scoping round: 

The aim of the questionnaires within the scoping round is to assess and understand: 
1.	If the current visual criteria are appropriate for the purpose of characterising disease severity, 
2.	Which other clinical signs should be included, 
3.	The understood use-cases for both the rapid and the extended field grading, 
4.	The perceived utility of various clinical signs used in how FGS is currently visually diagnosed,
5.	The form and content of a clinical grading tool. 
The first questionnaire has been formed based on a review of available literature and analysis of other successful clinical grading systems. The questionnaire has been designed to inform the content of subsequent surveys and therefore not all questions, such as the free text questions relating to current practice, require consensus to move onto the constructive round. The free text questions will be analysed for recurring themes. The binary questions (yes/no) will be analysed for percentage responses, with a consensus threshold 60%. The 1-10 range scale questions will again be analysed for percentage responses, with a consensus threshold of 70% of experts scoring within two points. 
Additional scoping round questionnaires may also be sent out, even if consensus is reached, if the responses to the free text questions reveal any area that requires further investigation.  
After the scoping phase is complete and consensus is reached on the close-ended (binary and range scale) questions, the Delphi process will proceed to the constructive round.

##### Constructive round:

In the constructive round questionnaires, experts will be presented with aspects of an FGS clinical grading system created based on the results of the scoping round questionnaires. 
The question format will primarily be binary (yes/no) and will be analysed for percentage agreement. A percentage agreement of 60% will be required to move from the constructive round to the refinement round questionnaires. 

##### Refinement round:

In the refinement rounds, the proposed clinical grading system/s will be presented to experts for a final chance to provide feedback. This is likely to be a combination of free text and binary (yes/no) and force choice questions. No further questionnaires will be sent out once a percentage agreement of 70% is reached on the final clinical grading system. 
If you are an expert that regularly reviews colposcope images for FGS, then we may ask you to take part in pilot testing the proposed clinical grading system/s by reviewing 200 images and grading them using the proposed grading system. This final round will be designed to validate the grading system. 

#### Duration

You will have three weeks to answer each survey round. Please get in touch if you do not believe you will be able to meet the deadline. The survey will have a minimum of three questionnaires, likely five to six in total. We foresee that the entire survey will take no more than six months.  We expect you will need to spend less than 30 minutes on each survey round. 

#### Anonymity

A key feature of a Delphi study is that participants remain anonymous. Any feedback you provided will be blinded to your fellow expert participants. This is to encourage open and honest opinions.

#### Expert Referral

If you believe you know someone who you think should be included in the expert panel, then please let us know during the onboarding questionnaire. The expert criteria are provided in the FAQ section of this document. Expert referral can only be made during the initial recruitment phase of this study and no referrals can be accepted once the first survey has been sent out. This is to ensure that all expert participants remain on the same timeline. 
Unfortunately, due to the requirements of anonymity we are unable to provide a list of participants. 

#### Participant Benefits

To be eligible for co-authorship of any future journal or resource publications, the following criteria needs to be met: 
+ Completion of the primary round questionnaires AND, 
+ Completion of at least one of the secondary round questionnaires AND, 
+ Review of the publication draft and confirmation that you are happy for it to be submitted.

An acknowledgment section will also be available for those who do not want to be considered for co-authorship or who do not meet the criteria for co-authorship.  You will be asked whether you would like to be considered for co-authorship during the onboarding questionnaire. 

#### Can I change my mind about taking part?

Yes.  You can withdraw from the study at any time, without providing any reason. Please note, due to the near-real-time nature of the Delphi, we will use any data provided up to the point of your withdrawal in our analysis and the formation of future survey questionnaires.

## Supporting Information and FAQs

#### What is a Delphi study and what are the benefits of this method?

Delphi studies are generally implemented when the knowledge that we have available is incomplete or uncertain. They work by first convening a group of experts in the field and then providing them with iterative rounds of survey questionnaires until consensus is reached. Each round is followed by a summary of the results from previous rounds and feedback sent to the expert participants. Thereby, Delphi facilitates a structured process for a group of experts to communicate. 

The Delphi methodology is well fitted to this study as there is currently a lack of consensus about how to systematically and reproducibly classify images for signs of disease.  It is highly likely that the current level of expertise is sufficient to build a clinically relevant, structurally granular and functionally systematic grading system. Future clinical and field studies may be able to be designed around the results of this study and there will be great value in performing formal diagnostic evaluations of any grading system created through this process. This is primarily because FGS is a disease that has complex, often subtle and highly heterogeneous presentation between cases. It remains unclear whether any clinical grading system for FGS can be diagnostically accurate (correct) or precise (repeatable) when used at scale, so understanding the potential role for a grading system in FGS diagnosis and management will be a key pathway to impact of this work.

#### Expert criteria: why am I being asked to do this?

You have been identified as an expert in the field of FGS, particularly relating to visual diagnosis. This is based on our expert criteria, as follows: 

+ Anyone who, in the last five years, has reviewed a colposcope image for the purposes of visually diagnosing or managing FGS.
  * If this was done in an academic capacity then the participant needs to have experience in, and a thorough understanding of, visual diagnostics for FGS and associated symptoms. To be considered, the participant needs to have     published an FGS paper within the last ten years.
    
  * If this was done in a field-based allied care practitioner capacity, then the participant should have experience with reviewing images and providing an FGS diagnosis based on visualisation. Job titles could include midwives, community health nurses, gynaecologists etc.

#### What is an example of a successful Delphi study?

Tamarozzi et al. (2024) conducted a Delphi study on definitions in imported human schistosomiasis. 

#### What is an example of a clinical grading system?

There are numerous examples of clinical severity grading systems that are in use. Systems such as the one being developed as part of this study have been successfully implemented in areas such as dermatology and ophthalmology. Examples include grading systems for atopic dermatitis (SCORAD),  pressure ulcer classification (NPUAP-EPUAP), diabetic neuropathy and trachoma.  

#### What will the outcome of this survey be?

Based on expert input, we aim to develop an FGS clinical grading system/s that will increase standardisation in visual diagnostics for FGS and change FGS diagnosis from binary to graded. 

The resultant clinical grading system/s will be developed alongside reference guides, including posters and information packs. The results will be written up and published in an open-source journal. 
Anonymised data, along with any resources developed as part of this study, will be provided completely open-source and free-of-charge. 

#### What is meant by consensus?

There is no standardised definition for consensus within Delphi protocols. For this study, the threshold for consensus differs depending on the question type and survey round, ranging from 60-70% agreement. 

For the study to conclude (termination criteria), there needs to be a percentage agreement of 70% in the refinement (final) round. The study will also be terminated if no consensus has been reached within seven questionnaires (within any number of rounds). If no consensus can be reached, then the results will still be analysed and presented for publication with the conclusion that consensus could not be reached.

#### Where will data be stored?
The surveys will be designed, and data collected using ODK. The data, including the names and addresses of the participants, will be stored on LSHTM’s SharePoint. All analysis will be done on a password-protected laptop.
