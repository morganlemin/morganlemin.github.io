# A scoping Delphi study for the co-development of a clinical visual grading system for female genital schistosomiasis. 

## Information sheet

#### What is the purpose of the study?

It has been more than ten years since members of the female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) field gathered to form a consensus on visual diagnostics for FGS. The resulting diagnostic criteria was based on the binary classification (presence/absence) of one or more of the classic lesion types (grainy sandy patches, homogenous sandy patches, abnormal vessels, and rubbery papules). The strictly binary diagnosis, which affords nothing to extent, severity or location of clinical signs, limits our ability to accurately assess and track the progression of FGS. The development of refined grading tool could not only provide guidance on the systematised classification of FGS symptoms but also inform appropriate management steps. Crucially, a grading system could also provide a standardised method to monitor disease progression, treatment efficacy, disease persistence and reoccurrence.

There are numerous examples of clinical severity grading systems that are in use, such as grading systems for atopic dermatitis (SCORAD), pressure ulcer classification (NPUAP-EPUAP), diabetic neuropathy and trachoma. The aims of this study, using Delphi methodology, are:

1.	To determine whether global experts in FGS have confidence in the use of clinical signs as indicators of disease and by doing so establish whether the development of a clinical visual grading system for FGS is justified.

2.	To understand the various settings in which such a system would be used, i.e. during live clinical examination and/or in post-examination review of photographs.

3.	To co-create grading systems that are appropriate for the settings determined above (see 2). Working with experts to reach consensus on what form the clinical grading system would take, for instance by establishing which clinical signs should be graded, and how.


#### What is a Delphi study?

Delphi studies are generally implemented when the knowledge available on a topic is incomplete or uncertain. They work by first convening a group of experts in the field and then providing them with iterative rounds of survey questionnaires until consensus is reached. Each questionnaire is followed by a summary of the results from previous questionnaire and feedback sent to the expert participants. Thereby, Delphi facilitates a structured process for a group of experts to communicate, reach consensus or define the areas where consensus is not possible. Tamarozzi et al. (2024) conducted a Delphi study on definitions in imported human schistosomiasis.

#### Why is the Delphi methodology appropriate for this study?

The Delphi methodology is well fitted to this study as there is currently a lack of consensus about how to systematically and reproducibly classify images for signs of disease. It is highly likely that the current level of expertise is sufficient to build a clinically relevant, structurally granular and functionally systematic grading system. Future clinical and field studies may be able to be designed around the results of this study and there will be great value in performing formal diagnostic evaluations of any grading system created through this process. This is primarily because FGS is a disease that has complex, often subtle and highly heterogeneous presentation between cases. It remains unclear whether any clinical grading system for FGS can be diagnostically accurate (correct) or precise (repeatable) when used at scale, so understanding the potential role for a grading system in FGS diagnosis and management will be a key pathway to impact of this work.

#### What is the process of this Delphi study?

There are three phases to this Delphi study; the scoping phase, the constructive phase, and the refinement phase. Each phase will involve one or more questionnaires (depending on how quickly consensus is reached) and have been designed to facilitate scoping co-development of one or more clinical grading systems.

##### Scoping phase: 

The aim of the questionnaires within the scoping phase is to assess and understand:

1.	If the current visual criteria are appropriate for the purpose of characterising disease severity,
2.	Which other clinical signs should be included,
3.	The understood use-cases for both a simplified and an extended field grading,
4.	The form and content of a clinical grading tool.

The first scoping phase questionnaire has been formed based on a review of available literature and analysis of other successful clinical grading systems. The first questionnaire has been designed to inform the content of subsequent surveys and therefore not all questions, such as the free text questions relating to current practice, require consensus to move onto the constructive phase. The free text questions will be analysed for recurring themes. The binary questions (yes/no) will be analysed for percentage responses, with a consensus threshold 60%. The 1-10 range scale questions will again be analysed for percentage responses, with a consensus threshold of 70% of experts scoring within two points. Additional scoping phase questionnaires may also be sent out, even if consensus is reached, if the responses to the free text questions reveal any area that requires further investigation.

After the scoping phase is complete and consensus is reached on the close-ended (binary and range scale) questions, the Delphi process will proceed to the constructive phase. 

##### Constructive phase:

In the constructive phase, experts will review aspects of various FGS clinical grading systems that have been developed using the findings from the scoping phase questionnaires. The question format will primarily be binary (yes/no) and will be analysed for percentage agreement. A percentage agreement of 60% will be required to move from the constructive phase to the refinement phase questionnaires. 

##### Refinement phase:

In the refinement phase, the proposed clinical grading system/s will be presented to experts for a final chance to provide feedback. No further questionnaires will be sent out once a percentage agreement of 70% is reached on the final clinical grading system. 

*If you are an expert that regularly reviews colposcope images for FGS, then we may ask you to take part in pilot testing the proposed clinical grading system/s by reviewing 200 images and grading them using the proposed grading system.*

After each questionnaire you will be provided with a summary of the results and opinions provided by the participants. This will be anonymised between the participants, however we will provide personalised reports to each expert participant, so you may see where your response sat in comparison with others.

#### Expert criteria

You have been identified as an expert in the field of visual diagnosis of FGS. This is based on our expert criteria, as follows:

Anyone who, in the last five years, has reviewed a colposcope image for the purposes of visually diagnosing or managing FGS.

+ If this was done in an academic capacity then the participant needs to have experience in, and a thorough understanding of, visual diagnostics for FGS and associated symptoms. The participant needs to have published a paper focusing on FGS within the last ten years.
+ If this was done in a field-based allied care practitioner capacity, then the participant should have experience with reviewing images and providing an FGS diagnosis based on visualisation. Job titles could include midwives, community health nurses, gynaecologists etc.

In total, we expect to have between 50-70 participants who meet the above expert criteria.

#### What is meant by consensus?

There is no standardised definition for consensus within Delphi protocols. For this study, the threshold for consensus differs depending on the question type and survey phase, ranging from 60-70% agreement.

For the study to conclude (termination criteria), there needs to be a percentage agreement of 70% in the refinement (final) phase. The study will also be terminated if no consensus has been reached within seven questionnaires (within any number of phases). If no consensus can be reached, then the results will still be analysed and presented for publication with the conclusion that consensus could not be reached.

#### What will the outcome of this survey be?

We aim to develop an FGS clinical grading system/s that will increase standardisation in visual diagnostics for FGS and change FGS diagnosis from binary to graded.

The resultant clinical grading system/s will be developed alongside reference guides, including posters and information packs. The results will be written up and published in an open-source journal. Anonymised data, along with any resources developed as part of this study, will be provided completely open-source and free-of-charge.

#### Duration

You will have three weeks to answer each survey questionnaire. Please get in touch if you think you will not be able to meet the deadline. The survey will have a minimum of three questionnaires, one per phase, likely five to six questionnaires in total. We foresee that the entire survey will take no more than six months. We expect you will need to spend less than 30 minutes on each questionnaire.

#### Anonymity

A key feature of a Delphi study is that participants remain anonymous. Any feedback you provided will be blinded to your fellow expert participants. This is to encourage open and honest opinions.

#### Expert Referral

If you believe you know someone who you think should be included in the expert panel, then please let us know during the onboarding questionnaire. The expert criteria are provided in the FAQ section of this document. Expert referral can only be made during the initial recruitment phase of this study and no referrals can be accepted once the first survey has been sent out. This is to ensure that all expert participants remain on the same timeline. 

Unfortunately, due to the requirements of anonymity we are unable to provide a list of participants. 

#### Participant Benefits

We offer co-authorship of any scientific publications that will be produced from the study. To be eligible for co-authorship, the following criteria needs to be met: 

+ Completion of the scoping phase questionnaires AND, 
+ Completion of at least one of the constructive phase questionnaires AND, 
+ Review of the publication draft and confirmation that you are happy for it to be submitted.

An acknowledgment section will also be available for those who do not want to be considered for co-authorship or who do not meet the criteria for co-authorship.   

#### Can I change my mind about taking part?

Yes.  You can withdraw from the study at any time, without providing any reason. Please note, due to the near-real-time nature of the Delphi, we will use any data provided up to the point of your withdrawal in our analysis and the formation of future survey questionnaires.
