<p>At present, just over half of participants had some form of standardised or structured system they used when assessing cervical images. No two participants described the same system, indicating that there is no standardisation between reviewers in current practice. Two of the responses (the MAPFGS protocol and the Qubifier) have elements of clinical grading scales. The MAPFGS study is using a numeric scale developed specifically for the study, and the Qubifier measures cervical lesion proportion.</p>
<p>The main uses for the grading system involved standardising data collection (particularly tracking lesion location and extent), diagnosing FGS, screening (as part of a research study), and quantifying proportion.</p>
<p>The majority of participants responded that the images they review regularly include the ectocervix (either as a whole or in quadrants), cervical fornices, and vaginal walls. Five participants responded that they also include the external genitalia for review.</p>

<p>The most common response to a healthy cervix was the presence of a uniform/homogeneous pink colour, smooth surface and round shape (which can change over the course of a lifetime). The healthy cervix was also characterised by the absence of several factors (including lesions, inflammation, abnormal discharge and abnormal smell).</p>

<p>Participants were given two hypothetical scenarios. In the first scenario, they were asked how many of the true positive cases they would expect to show visual signs of FGS. The median response was 72 (IQR = 40). This indicates that experts believe they would see visual signs of FGS in the majority of positive cases, but may still miss a large proportion.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, participants were asked how many images they still believed would have visual signs of FGS despite all images being from 100 TRUE NEGATIVE cases. The median response was 27 (IQR = 53).</p>
<p>In both scenarios, the high IQR indicates a high degree of variability.</p>

<li><p><em>“Simplified clinical grading system will ease the workload of the caregivers, who are, in general nurses and midwives, who receive the women in consultation in the regions where FGS is hyperendemic”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“Many of these women/ girls are from rural / poor settings, they can’t afford to come back to the clinic for follow-up investigations. Therefore it’s important to simplify this to the point that a nurse/ medical officer can use it. It has to be cheap, user friendly etc..”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“that would enable use at the lowest point in the health system, e.g health centre as it is usually nursing or midwife technicians providing care in these setting, i.e.&nbsp;for most LMICs.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“Help us to diagnose and offer treatment as soon as possible and help us to avoid having different opinions about one image seen by different people.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“It will help for the follow-up(s) to identify if the lesion(s) is/are at the same section or there is new lesion in other section that were lesion(s) free.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“It would be more acceptable by field workers and allow more individuals to access the service.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“To avoid treatment delays and missing out positive images,easy in making decisions,and to maintain the standards”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“A simplified clinical grading system could help clinicians assess the likelihood of an FGS diagnosis. Potentially also whether to offer treatment in the form of praziquantel (PZQ). However, if a woman lives/comes from an area with possible schistosomiasis and has water exposure, I would ideally recommend PZQ treatment regardless of what signs of FGS are present. Furthermore, PZQ treatment does not seem to be efficient in treating fx cervical lesions associated with FGS. A clinical grading system might not have big implications for diagnosis and treatment right now. Perhaps if/when other treatment (fx local treatment) are identified a clinical grading system may become more relevant in the clinical setting. A clinical grading system may be very beneficial in terms of research in FGS. It may help provide a a common language to describe and discuss FGS among researchers, as well as clinicians.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“To check for severity of FGS”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“It is needed at the point of care a field clinic setting for ease of use in limited Resources settings, for quick and accurate diagnosis, improved accessibility, standardization of care, time internation, enhanced patient education, support for public and healthy data collection as well as facilitating training and awareness.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“A more simplified one is needed, atleast something that can make the examiner make a specific diagnosis feature”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“I think it is required because sometimes at a point of clinical need, one can receive care as required, which helps to be highly suspicious of the problem.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“In some low resource settings, visual diagnosis, though imperfect is the only diagnostic available. While other high sensitivity and high specificity diagnostics should be strongly prioritized, if there is no other option, a simplified FGS clinical grading system could have utility where there are truly no other options.”</em></p></li>

<p>All experts agreed that a simplified clinical grading system is needed. A recurring theme in the responses was that something is needed at the point-of-care for rapid decision making, as many women in resource constrained settings are not able to return for a diagnosis. Other recurring themes in response to why a simplified system is needed include &nbsp;the need to simplify the healthcare workers workload, and to assist in tracking lesions for followup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of experts agreed that an EXTENDED clinical grading system is needed. Multiple experts suggested that this extended system, while potentially not appropriate for a point-of-care tool, would be useful in a research setting. Other suggested reasons for using it were to supplement the simplified system to increase confidence in a diagnosis and provide a more detailed and comprehensive characterisation of the disease.</p>
<p>Those who said an extended system was not needed suggested it would be confusing and overly complicated for clinicians, that it is unlikely to impact treatment outcomes, and that training on a complex grading system might cause issues with implementation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In round one, 15/17 experts agreed that homogenous sandy patches should be included in an FGS clinical grading system. According to these results, experts believe that homogenous sandy patches can be identified in approximately 50% of true positive cases while lesions that appear similar to homogenous sandy patches could be identified in ~20% (IQR 23) of cases without FGS.</p>
<p>Of those experts that believed homogenous sandy patches should be included, the majority believed that the extent, location and intensity of the patches matter when reviewing images for FGS.</p>

<p>The majority of experts (16/17) agreed that grainy sandy patches should be included in a clinical grading system. The experts believed that grainy sandy patches could be identified in just under 50% of cases, however the response to this question varied significantly (IQR = 47). The results indicate that experts view grainy sandy patches as a specific indicator of FGS, suggesting that they would appear in around 5% (IQR = 13) of images of FGS negative women.</p>

<li><p><em>“Rubbery papules have only been documented in Madagascar. I believe they have been seen in Eswatini as well. Hence rubbery papules usefulness may depend on geography”.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“It is useful particularly in assessing advanced cases of the diseases. There appearance offers additional insight into disease progression making it easier for clinicians to diagnosize chronic FGs and choose appropriate management protocols”.</em></p></li>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rubbery-papules-summary">5.4.8 Rubbery Papules Summary</h5>
<p>The majority of experts (15/17) agreed that rubbery papules should be included in a clinical grading system. Experts appear to believe that rubbery papules are infrequent and occur in approximately 20% of FGS positive cases (IQR = 16). They also believe that rubbery papules are very specific to FGS, appearing in less than 10% of images from FGS negative women (IQR = 7). The additional comments suggest that, while they might be easier to spot when they are present compared to other lesion types, few experts have seen them in-person. Geography, co-infection and differing species were all suggested as reasons why they are spotted rarely. The majority of experts believe that the extent and intensity of the rubbery papules matter while reviewing images for FGS.</p>

Experts responded that the extent, location and intensity of the contact bleeding all matter when reviewing images for FGS. In the additional responses, experts suggested that contact bleeding may be as a result or coincide with other lesions and may be a useful indication of severity.</p>
